# Communication System Project: Normal AM (Modulation and Demodulation)

## Overview
This project focuses on the practical applications of amplitude modulation (AM) and demodulation. It provides experience in implementing theoretical and practical knowledge in the field of communication systems.

## Objectives
The main objectives of this project are:
- To generate a standard AM waveform using a switching modulator.
- To retrieve the original signal using an envelope detector circuit.
- To face challenges like dual sideband carrier waveform production, precise signal retrieval, modulation control, distortion reduction, and noise management in the demodulated signal.

## Tools Used
The project extensively uses MATLAB "Codes ans Simulink" for data analysis, signal processing, simulations, and system "circuit design". And TinkerCad.

## Procedure
The project is divided into two phases:
- Phase One covers AM modulation, demodulation circuit using MATLAB.

- Phase Two focuses on building the circuit using the components in TinkerCad to see the results on oscilloscope.
